`database.base`: Database name  
`database.username`: Database username  
`database.password`: Database password  
`mysql.database`: Database name  


## Commands

`trail`: Used by authorized players to view the available trails (if no parameter specified), activate one (with the correct name) or turn them off (with the 'off' value).


## Permissions

`iotrails.enable`: Access to the `/trail` command.
